## Installation

The *Knowin' Notes* frontend uses React with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) v12.22.9. We cannot guaruntee the application runs as expected on other versions, so, for the best results, install v12.22.9. You installation of node should come with the Node Package Manager (npm). Add both node and npm to you PATH. Ensure you are using npm v10.9.0. You can check your version numbers with the commands

    node -v
    npm -v

where the expected output is

    v12.22.9
    10.9.0

Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. To install all of the project dependancies, run

    npm install

At this point, the *Knowin' Notes* frontend is ready to be launched. The backend must be running for all functionality to be available. See [the backend](https://github.com/COMP4721-F24/Team-4) for instructions on installing and running the backend.

## Getting Started

In the root directory of this repository, to launch the application, run the command

    npm run dev

In your browser, enter the URL [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). This should load the *Knowin' Notes* main menu. From this menu, you can choose to view the history, which contains reports of your previous sessions, or select the start button to select your session settings and practice knowin' notes.
